# EVM Trading Bot

A smart contract-based trading bot for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchains.

## Overview

This project implements a time-locked contract system with ownership controls, designed as a foundation for automated trading strategies on EVM-compatible blockchains. The core contract (`Lock.sol`) provides basic functionality for state management, time-based operations, and secure fund handling.

## Features

- **Time-locked operations**: Contract functions are secured behind time-based locks
- **Ownership control**: Critical functions protected by OpenZeppelin's Ownable pattern
- **Event tracking**: Comprehensive event emission for off-chain monitoring
- **Fund management**: Secure ETH handling with withdrawal controls
- **TypeScript support**: Full TypeChain-generated TypeScript bindings for type-safe interactions

## Smart Contract Architecture

The main contract (`Lock.sol`) includes:

- Time-locked withdrawal mechanism
- State toggling functionality
- Owner-only privileged operations
- ETH receiving capability
- Event emission for important state changes

## Technical Stack

- **Solidity**: ^0.8.20
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts**: For secure ownership implementation
- **TypeChain**: For TypeScript type generation
- **Hardhat**: Development environment (implied by the project structure)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn
- An Ethereum wallet with testnet ETH for deployment

### Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/llakterian/evm_trading_bot.git
cd evm_trading_bot
npm install
```

### Compile Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

### Run Tests

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Deploy to Testnet

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
```

## Contract Usage

### Deployment

The Lock contract is deployed with a default unlock time of 1 week from deployment.

### Key Functions

- `someFunction()`: View function to check the current state
- `toggleState()`: Owner-only function to toggle the contract state
- `withdraw()`: Owner-only function to withdraw funds after unlock time

### Events

- `ValueChanged`: Emitted when the contract state is toggled
- `Withdrawn`: Emitted when funds are withdrawn

## Development

### TypeScript Integration

The project uses TypeChain to generate TypeScript bindings for the smart contracts, enabling type-safe interactions from your frontend or scripts.

## Security Considerations

- The contract implements time-locking mechanisms to prevent premature withdrawals
- Owner-only functions protect critical operations
- Consider additional security measures for production deployments:
  - Multi-signature ownership
  - Emergency pause functionality
  - More granular access controls
